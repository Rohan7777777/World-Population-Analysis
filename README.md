# World-Population-Analysis

üåç World Population Data Analysis
This project performs a comprehensive data analysis pipeline on a global population dataset. The dataset includes population statistics for over 230 countries/territories across multiple decades (1970‚Äì2022), along with geographic and demographic features like area, population density, growth rate, and more.

üîß Workflow Includes:
Data Preprocessing

Cleaning column names

Handling missing values

Type conversions and standardization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive statistics

Most and least populous countries

Population distribution by continent

Historical growth trends

Feature Engineering

Absolute population growth (2000‚Äì2022)

CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)

Density category segmentation (Low/Medium/High)

Model Building

Predictive models (e.g., Linear Regression) to estimate 2022 population from historical data

Model Evaluation

Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R¬≤

Model comparison and interpretation

Data Visualization

Correlation heatmaps

Bar charts for top/bottom countries

Growth trends and prediction plots
